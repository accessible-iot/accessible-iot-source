keyContribution: "Open-source hardware platform for ear-based biopotential sensing, enabling accessible IoT health monitoring"
abstract: |
  OpenEarable ExG presents an open-source hardware platform designed for ear-based biopotential sensing applications. This platform enables researchers and developers to create accessible health monitoring solutions using wearable ear-worn devices.

This paper introduces OpenEarable ExG, an innovative open-source hardware platform that democratizes ear-based biopotential sensing. By making the designs and schematics freely available, the research enables a wide range of applications in health monitoring, cognitive state detection, and accessibility tools.

The platform supports various biopotential signals including EOG (electrooculography), EMG (electromyography), and ECG (electrocardiography), all captured from the ear region. This positions OpenEarable as a key enabling technology for the Internet of Things in healthcare and accessibility contexts.
