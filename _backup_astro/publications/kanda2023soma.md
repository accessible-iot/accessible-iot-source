keyContribution: "Novel IoT toolkit that leverages heightened somatosensory capacities of people with visual impairments for cross-ability interaction"
abstract: |
  The Soma Express Kit is a novel toolkit that capitalizes on the heightened somatosensory capacities of people with visual impairments. It integrates wearable physiological sensors and multi-sensory modules including haptics and sound to communicate somaesthetic experiences.
---

This research introduces an innovative approach to understanding and sharing the embodied experiences of people with visual impairments. The Soma Express Kit uses IoT sensors and multi-sensory feedback to create new channels of communication between people with and without visual impairments.

By embracing the somaesthetic potential of people with visual impairments, this work fosters empathy and enables richer collaborative cross-ability interactions. The toolkit represents a significant contribution to inclusive IoT design, moving beyond traditional assistive technology paradigms.
