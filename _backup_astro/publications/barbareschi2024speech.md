keyContribution: "First study on non-verbal communication strategies between visually impaired runners and sighted guides"
abstract: |
  This paper presents the first in-depth study of micro-communication strategies used between visually impaired runners and their sighted guides. Through observations and interviews, we identify patterns of verbal and non-verbal communication that enable effective coordination during running activities.

This groundbreaking research explores the subtle communication patterns that enable visually impaired runners and their guides to move together effectively. The study reveals intricate verbal and non-verbal signaling strategies that have developed organically in the running community, providing insights for designing better assistive technologies for sports and physical activities.

Key findings include the importance of silence as a form of communication, indicating smooth coordination, and the role of micro-adjustments in maintaining synchronization between runner and guide.
