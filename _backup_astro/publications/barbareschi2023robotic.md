keyContribution: "Demonstrated that disabled workers can effectively control multiple robotic avatars simultaneously in a real café environment"
abstract: |
  This paper presents a real-world implementation where disabled workers in a café simultaneously control multiple robotic avatars to serve customers. The study reveals that parallel embodiment increases workers' agency and enables them to better manage customer journeys.

A groundbreaking study conducted in a real café environment where disabled workers operated multiple robotic avatars in parallel. The research demonstrates that people with disabilities possess specific competencies that enhance their ability to manage multiple embodied presences simultaneously.

The findings have significant implications for employment opportunities and workplace accessibility, showing how assistive robotics can create new forms of meaningful work for people with mobility impairments.

This work was featured in multiple accessibility newsletters and demonstrates the practical application of IoT and robotics in creating inclusive workspaces.
