keyContribution: "Framework for ethical eye-tracking-based cognitive well-being monitoring that balances detection accuracy with user privacy and autonomy"
abstract: |
  This paper explores the ethical considerations of using eye-tracking technology for monitoring cognitive well-being. It proposes a framework that balances the benefits of detecting cognitive states with the need for ethical feedback mechanisms and user privacy.

As eye-tracking becomes increasingly integrated into wearable devices and IoT systems, questions arise about how to ethically monitor and provide feedback about users' cognitive states. This research addresses these concerns head-on, proposing design principles that prioritize user autonomy and well-being.

The work is particularly relevant for accessibility applications where cognitive monitoring could support people with attention difficulties, mental health challenges, or neurodivergent individuals, while respecting their privacy and agency.
