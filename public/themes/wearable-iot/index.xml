By making the designs and schematics freely available, the research enables a wide range of applications in health monitoring, cognitive state detection, and accessibility tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The platform supports various biopotential signals including EOG (electrooculography), EMG (electromyography), and ECG (electrocardiography), all captured from the ear region. This positions OpenEarable as a key enabling technology for the Internet of Things in healthcare and accessibility contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Soma Express Kit</title><link>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/kanda2023soma/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/kanda2023soma/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This research introduces an innovative approach to understanding and sharing the embodied experiences of people with visual impairments. The Soma Express Kit uses IoT sensors and multi-sensory feedback to create new channels of communication between people with and without visual impairments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By embracing the somaesthetic potential of people with visual impairments, this work fosters empathy and enables richer collaborative cross-ability interactions. The toolkit represents a significant contribution to inclusive IoT design, moving beyond traditional assistive technology paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
