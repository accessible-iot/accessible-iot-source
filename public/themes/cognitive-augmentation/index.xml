By tracking how users&amp;rsquo; eyes follow their own body motions, the system creates new opportunities for hands-free control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technique has particular relevance for accessibility, enabling people with limited hand mobility to interact with technology using natural body movements and gaze. It represents an innovative approach to inclusive interface design in the context of ubiquitous computing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Eye-Tracking for Cognitive Well-Being</title><link>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/kim2025eye/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/kim2025eye/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As eye-tracking becomes increasingly integrated into wearable devices and IoT systems, questions arise about how to ethically monitor and provide feedback about users&amp;rsquo; cognitive states. This research addresses these concerns head-on, proposing design principles that prioritize user autonomy and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work is particularly relevant for accessibility applications where cognitive monitoring could support people with attention difficulties, mental health challenges, or neurodivergent individuals, while respecting their privacy and agency.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
