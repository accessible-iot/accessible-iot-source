By tracking how users&rsquo; eyes follow their own body motions, the system creates new opportunities for hands-free control.</p><p>The technique has particular relevance for accessibility, enabling people with limited hand mobility to interact with technology using natural body movements and gaze. It represents an innovative approach to inclusive interface design in the context of ubiquitous computing.</p></article><article class=card><h3><a href=https://accessible-iot.org/publications/kim2025eye/>Eye-Tracking for Cognitive Well-Being</a></h3><p>As eye-tracking becomes increasingly integrated into wearable devices and IoT systems, questions arise about how to ethically monitor and provide feedback about users&rsquo; cognitive states. This research addresses these concerns head-on, proposing design principles that prioritize user autonomy and well-being.</p><p>The work is particularly relevant for accessibility applications where cognitive monitoring could support people with attention difficulties, mental health challenges, or neurodivergent individuals, while respecting their privacy and agency.</p></article><article class=card><h3><a href=https://accessible-iot.org/publications/zaidi2025tieboard/>TIEboard: A Digital Educational Tool for Kids Geometric Learning</a></h3><p>TIEboard represents an innovative approach to making mathematics education more accessible and inclusive for children. By combining tangible interaction with digital feedback, the tool creates an engaging learning environment that supports diverse learning styles.</p><p>The research demonstrates how IoT-enabled educational tools can bridge the gap between abstract mathematical concepts and concrete, hands-on learning experiences.</p></article><article class=card><h3><a href=https://accessible-iot.org/publications/barbareschi2025sticking/>Sticking With Electronics for Crafting Practices</a></h3><p>This work addresses the digital divide by making electronics and IoT creation accessible to older adults. Through carefully designed crafting activities that incorporate electronics, the research shows how older adults can develop technical literacy while engaging in creative, meaningful activities.</p><p>The findings have important implications for inclusive design in IoT, showing that with appropriate support and methods, technology creation can be made accessible across age groups and technical backgrounds.</p></article><article class=card><h3><a href=https://accessible-iot.org/publications/xu2025cuddle/>Cuddle-Fish: Exploring a Soft Floating Robot with Flapping Wings for Physical Interactions</a></h3><p>Cuddle-Fish presents an innovative soft floating robot with flapping wings designed for safe physical interactions. The soft materials and gentle motion make it suitable for therapeutic and assistive applications, particularly in contexts requiring calming, non-threatening robotic presence.</p></article><article class=card><h3><a href=https://accessible-iot.org/publications/lepold2024openarable/>OpenEarable ExG: Open-Source Hardware for Ear-Based Biopotential Sensing Applications</a></h3><p>This paper introduces OpenEarable ExG, an innovative open-source hardware platform that democratizes ear-based biopotential sensing. By making the designs and schematics freely available, the research enables a wide range of applications in health monitoring, cognitive state detection, and accessibility tools.</p><p>The platform supports various biopotential signals including EOG (electrooculography), EMG (electromyography), and ECG (electrocardiography), all captured from the ear region. This positions OpenEarable as a key enabling technology for the Internet of Things in healthcare and accessibility contexts.</p></article><article class=card><h3><a href=https://accessible-iot.org/publications/barbareschi2024speech/>Speech is Silver, Silence is Golden</a></h3><p>This groundbreaking research explores the subtle communication patterns that enable visually impaired runners and their guides to move together effectively. The study reveals intricate verbal and non-verbal signaling strategies that have developed organically in the running community, providing insights for designing better assistive technologies for sports and physical activities.</p><p>Key findings include the importance of silence as a form of communication, indicating smooth coordination, and the role of micro-adjustments in maintaining synchronization between runner and guide.</p></article><article class=card><h3><a href=https://accessible-iot.org/publications/kanda2023soma/>Soma Express Kit</a></h3><p>This research introduces an innovative approach to understanding and sharing the embodied experiences of people with visual impairments. The Soma Express Kit uses IoT sensors and multi-sensory feedback to create new channels of communication between people with and without visual impairments.</p><p>By embracing the somaesthetic potential of people with visual impairments, this work fosters empathy and enables richer collaborative cross-ability interactions. The toolkit represents a significant contribution to inclusive IoT design, moving beyond traditional assistive technology paradigms.</p></article><article class=card><h3><a href=https://accessible-iot.org/publications/barbareschi2023robotic/>I am both here and there</a></h3><p>A groundbreaking study conducted in a real café environment where disabled workers operated multiple robotic avatars in parallel. The research demonstrates that people with disabilities possess specific competencies that enhance their ability to manage multiple embodied presences simultaneously.</p><p>The findings have significant implications for employment opportunities and workplace accessibility, showing how assistive robotics can create new forms of meaningful work for people with mobility impairments.</p><p>This work was featured in multiple accessibility newsletters and demonstrates the practical application of IoT and robotics in creating inclusive workspaces.</p></article><article class=card><h3><a href=https://accessible-iot.org/publications/zhang2022seeing/>Seeing our Blind Spots</a></h3><p>Traditional visual impairment simulation tools are static and fail to account for dynamic eye movements. This research introduces a smart glasses-based system that provides realistic, dynamic simulations of various visual impairments.</p><p>The system was evaluated with design students, demonstrating significant improvements in their awareness and understanding of visual accessibility challenges. Questionnaires and qualitative feedback confirmed that the dynamic, eye-movement-aware simulation helped participants develop more empathetic and informed approaches to inclusive design.</p></article></div></main></div></body></html>
