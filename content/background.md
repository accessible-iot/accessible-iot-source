## Project Overview

The Accessible IoT project focuses on developing accessibility assessment tools for the Internet of Things, supported by JST Presto Grant JPMJPR2132 (2021-2025).

## Vision

Our vision is to create Open Accessibility Assessment Toolkits for Inclusive IoT Design that provide a foundation for evaluating diverse IoT services in terms of user-perceived accessibility. We focus initially on on-body sensing technologies to enable dynamic, in-situ system reconfiguration based on users' implicit feedback.

## Why Accessibility Assessment Toolkits?

The Internet of Things is rapidly expanding into all aspects of daily life, from smart homes to wearable health monitors. However, these technologies often fail to consider the needs of people with disabilities, older adults, and other marginalized groups.

Traditional accessibility evaluation methods are:
- **Static**: They don't adapt to users' changing needs and contexts
- **Reactive**: They identify problems after systems are built
- **Limited**: They focus on single devices rather than interconnected IoT ecosystems

Our approach addresses these limitations by:
1. Using on-body sensing to capture real-time user experiences
2. Enabling dynamic system reconfiguration based on implicit feedback
3. Providing tools that work across diverse IoT services and contexts

## Research Approach

### On-Body Sensing

We use wearable sensors and smart eyewear to capture:
- Physiological signals (heart rate, eye movements, muscle activity)
- User interactions with IoT devices
- Environmental context
- Cognitive and emotional states

### Inclusive Design Methods

Our research involves:
- Co-design with people with diverse abilities
- Somaesthetic approaches that value embodied experiences
- Open-source hardware and software platforms
- Real-world deployments and evaluations

### Multi-Dimensional Impact

The project spans multiple research areas:
- **Visual Accessibility**: Smart glasses simulations, eye-tracking systems
- **Assistive Robotics**: Telepresence robots for employment
- **Wearable IoT**: Open-source ear-based sensing platforms
- **Educational Tools**: Accessible learning systems for children
- **Cognitive Augmentation**: Ethical well-being monitoring

## Key Outcomes

Through this project, we have:
- Published 10+ papers in top-tier venues (CHI, UbiComp, UIST, ETRA)
- Developed open-source hardware platforms (OpenEarable ExG)
- Created practical tools for accessibility education
- Demonstrated real-world applications in cafés and schools
- Built frameworks for ethical implementation

## Future Directions

As the grant concludes in 2025, we continue to pursue:
- Broader adoption of accessibility assessment tools
- Integration with emerging IoT standards
- Expansion to new domains and user groups
- Long-term impact on inclusive design practices

## Funding

This research is supported by JST Presto Grant JPMJPR2132.
