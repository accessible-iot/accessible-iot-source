keyContribution: "Comprehensive survey establishing theoretical foundations for human-computer integration research"
---

This comprehensive survey paper establishes the theoretical foundations for human-computer integration (HCI), exploring how the human body can be integrated with computational machines. The work provides a framework for understanding and advancing research in human augmentation and embodied interaction.
