keyContribution: "Dynamic smart glasses-based simulation system that considers eye movements, improving accessibility awareness training"
---

Traditional visual impairment simulation tools are static and fail to account for dynamic eye movements. This research introduces a smart glasses-based system that provides realistic, dynamic simulations of various visual impairments.

The system was evaluated with design students, demonstrating significant improvements in their awareness and understanding of visual accessibility challenges. Questionnaires and qualitative feedback confirmed that the dynamic, eye-movement-aware simulation helped participants develop more empathetic and informed approaches to inclusive design.

This work bridges the gap between accessibility theory and practice, providing tangible tools for educating the next generation of designers about inclusive IoT systems.
