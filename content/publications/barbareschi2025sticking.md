keyContribution: "Inclusive approach to teaching electronics and making skills to older adults through crafting practices"
---

This work addresses the digital divide by making electronics and IoT creation accessible to older adults. Through carefully designed crafting activities that incorporate electronics, the research shows how older adults can develop technical literacy while engaging in creative, meaningful activities.

The findings have important implications for inclusive design in IoT, showing that with appropriate support and methods, technology creation can be made accessible across age groups and technical backgrounds.
