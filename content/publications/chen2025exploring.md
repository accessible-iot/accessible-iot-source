keyContribution: "Physiological study of singing breath patterns with design directions for breath-aware mixed reality augmentation"
---

This paper explores the physiological aspects of singing breath control and proposes design directions for breath-aware augmentation in mixed reality. The work provides insights into respiratory patterns during singing and how they can be leveraged for immersive training experiences.
