keyContribution: "Wearable system that visualizes physiological signals to support emotion regulation through somaesthetic appreciation"
---

The Affective Umbrella is a wearable system that visualizes heart and electrodermal activity in real-time. The work explores how somaesthetic appreciation of one's own physiological signals can support emotion regulation and self-awareness.
