keyContribution: "Novel multimodal sensing approach combining EMG and ultrasonography for analyzing vocal techniques in singing"
---

This paper introduces a novel sensing method that combines surface EMG with ultrasonography to analyze vocal techniques during singing pitch control. The multimodal approach provides deeper insights into the physiological mechanisms of singing and opens new possibilities for vocal training systems.
