keyContribution: "Novel gaze interaction technique based on smooth pursuit eye movements tracking body motion, enabling hands-free interaction"
---

This research explores how the natural eye movement pattern of smooth pursuit can be used for interaction with IoT systems and wearable devices. By tracking how users' eyes follow their own body motions, the system creates new opportunities for hands-free control.

The technique has particular relevance for accessibility, enabling people with limited hand mobility to interact with technology using natural body movements and gaze. It represents an innovative approach to inclusive interface design in the context of ubiquitous computing.
